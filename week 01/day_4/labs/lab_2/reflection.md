This sprint was a valuable learning experience as our team delivered the CI Dashboard feature for the DevOps platform.Despite encountering challenges, we applied Scrum principes effectively to stay aligned with our goal.
Regarding adaptation,the team initially focused on the core dashboard and filtering features.Mid-sprint, we discovered that the CI API doc was outdated and responses were slower than expected.To manage the issue, we prioritized UI and modal work while the Scrum Master obtained updated API details, and we later added a small caching with Redis to improve the performance.
Daily Scrums improved coordination by surfacing blockers early.Yuinis and Ravan quickly raides APi concerns and the team openly addressed a filtering bug found during testings by adddings and priortizing a fix.This transparency prevented delays and mainted steady progress.
The Spring goal also helped us manage scope. When email notis were suggested mid-sprint, the team deffered the request to the Product Backlog to maintain focus on the current sprint.
Our DoD was icnluding code review, unit and integrations tests and staging validation-ready quality remained high despite the time pressure. In the Sprint Retrospective, we identified the need for earlier validation of external dependencies and agreed to add an API  verification step and continue pair programming on complex tasks.
Overall, the team demonstrated strong openness and courage and the sprint improve our collaboration, adaptability and alignment with Scrum.
