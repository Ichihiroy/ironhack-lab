This sprint was a valuable learning experience as our team delivered the CI Dashboard feature for the DevOps platform. Despite encountering challenges, we applied Scrum practices effectively to stay aligned with our Sprint Goal.

Regarding adaptation, the team initially focused on the core dashboard and filtering features. Mid-sprint, we discovered the CI API documentation was outdated and responses were slower than expected. To manage the risk, we prioritized UI and modal work while the Scrum Master obtained updated API details, and we later added a small caching task to improve performance.

Daily Scrums improved coordination by surfacing blockers early. Yunis and Ravan quickly raised API concerns, and the team openly addressed a filtering bug found during testing by adding and prioritizing a fix. This transparency prevented delays and maintained steady progress.

The Sprint Goal also helped us manage scope. When email notifications were suggested mid-sprint, the team deferred the request to the Product Backlog to maintain focus on committed work.

Our Definition of Done was including code review, unit and integration tests, and staging validation—ensured quality remained high despite time pressure. In the Sprint Retrospective, we identified the need for earlier validation of external dependencies and agreed to add an API verification step and continue pair programming on complex tasks.

Overall, the team demonstrated strong Openness and Courage, and the sprint improved our collaboration, adaptability, and alignment with Scrum and DevOps practices.
