Scrum and DevOps actually play really well together. Short sprints push you to ship working software (in most cases), which is the heart of the continuos delivery. Daily standups and sprint reviews get developer and ops team communicate with each other instead of staying in their silos.And because you are aiming to have something potentially shippable at the end of every sprint, you naturally start automating tests, builds and deployment, which is basically DevOps in action.
