Scrum and DevOps actually play really well together. Short sprints push you to ship working software often, which is the heart of continuous delivery. Daily stand-ups and sprint reviews get developers and ops people talking every day instead of staying in their silos.And because you’re aiming to have something potentially shippable at the end of every sprint, you naturally start automating tests, builds, and deployment, which is basically DevOps in action.
